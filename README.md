# DAW

### What is this?

This is a playground for testing out using the web audio api to build
and in browser digital audio workstation.

### Goals

* Experiment with building reusable abstractions around the web audio api.
* Build out a UI interface that is not overwelming
* Be able to produce actual prototypes rapidly
* Experiment with collaboration in the browser
* Experiment with visual diffing and merging of wavfiles.

### Install

* `npm install --dev` This will also install bower deps, unzip audio samples, and bundle js files.
* `npm run start-dev` (assumes [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) to be installed globally)
* `open localhost:8080`

with me please feel free to checkout the issues.

If you find an issue you'd like to workon please open up a separate branch.

If you'd like to report issues, please keep in mind that this is a new api and is
not expected to work in all browsers. Current targets are current Firefox and Chrome.
